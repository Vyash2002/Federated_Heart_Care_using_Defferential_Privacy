### Federated Heart-Care using Differential Privacy

📌 Overview

Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. This project leverages Federated
Learning (FL) and Differential Privacy (DP) to build a privacy-preserving heart disease
prediction system.

Instead of centralizing sensitive patient data, the system enables multiple healthcare institutions
to collaboratively train models while ensuring data confidentiality. Streamlit provides an
interactive dashboard for real-time predictions and visualizations.

✨ Features

● Federated Learning Framework: Collaborative model training across multiple clients
(simulated hospitals) without sharing raw patient data.
● Differential Privacy Integration: Uses DP-SGD (via Opacus) to add noise and
guarantee privacy.
● Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and ANN.
● Visualization & EDA: Feature importance, confusion matrices, accuracy graphs, etc.
● Interactive Streamlit Dashboard:
  ○ Upload datasets (.csv, .xlsx)
  ○ Configure privacy parameters (noise multiplier, clipping norm)
  ○ Visualize training and evaluation metrics
  ○ Predict heart disease risk for new patients in real-time
